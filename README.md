## Which class should be refactored first?

This is a little experimental project that might be thrown away later.

The **problem** is the following: I regularly run metrics on my Java projects and
I am trying to find which classes I should refactor first. Two characteristics
of each class I am interested in are *cyclomatic complexity* and *afferent coupling*
(or fan-in).

We are looking for classes that the **combination** of complexity and fan-in is high
because if it is used more often and is it complex then it is riskier. So I need
to figure out a way to sort a list based on two things. A friend of mine 
suggested to take a look in [principal component statistics](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/index.html)

This is a ruby script that uses [pca gem](https://github.com/gbuesing/pca) which uses the [Gnu Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/).
It reads a csv file that has the results generated by [ckjm](http://www.spinellis.gr/sw/ckjm/) on a Java project.
Then it runs the algorithm and tries to sort the classes in the order that they
should be refactored.
